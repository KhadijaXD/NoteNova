# NoteNova AI Features

NoteNova uses Llama 3.3 (70B) to provide powerful AI features that enhance your note-taking experience. All AI features are integrated directly into the application with no additional setup required!

## AI-Powered Features

### 1. Smart Summaries
Our AI automatically generates concise summaries of your notes, focusing on the most important information. This helps you quickly review your notes without having to read through all the content.

### 2. Flashcard Generation
NoteNova can generate study flashcards from your notes with just one click. The AI identifies key concepts and creates question/answer pairs to help you study and review.

### 3. Auto-Tagging
When you upload or create a note, NoteNova's AI can identify relevant topics and automatically tag your content, making it easier to organize and find your notes later.

## How It Works

NoteNova seamlessly connects to Meta's Llama 3.3 (70B) model via a secure API. All processing happens in the cloud, which means:

- No need to install any additional software
- No large model downloads required
- Works consistently across all devices
- Faster processing than local models

## Privacy and Security

- Your notes are only transmitted when you use an AI feature
- Data is not stored or used for model training
- API connections are secured using industry-standard encryption
